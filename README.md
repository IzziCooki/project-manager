# Firebase Configuration

## Setup Instructions

To configure Firebase for this project, you need to update the API keys and values in the `firebase.js` file.

### Step 1: Get Your Firebase Configuration

1. Go to the [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/)
2. Select your project (or create a new one)
3. Click on the gear icon (Settings) and select "Project settings"
4. Scroll down to the "Your apps" section
5. Click on the web app icon (`</>`) or select your existing web app
6. Copy the configuration object

### Step 2: Update firebase.js

Replace the empty strings in your `firebase.js` file with your actual Firebase configuration values:

javascript
const firebaseConfig = {
  apiKey: "your-api-key-here",
  authDomain: "your-project-id.firebaseapp.com",
  projectId: "your-project-id",
  storageBucket: "your-project-id.appspot.com",
  messagingSenderId: "your-sender-id",
  appId: "your-app-id",
  measurementId: "your-measurement-id"
};
```

### Configuration Values Explanation

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `apiKey` | Your web API key for Firebase |
| `authDomain` | The domain used for Firebase Authentication |
| `projectId` | Your Firebase project ID |
| `storageBucket` | The default Cloud Storage bucket |
| `messagingSenderId` | The sender ID for Firebase Cloud Messaging |
| `appId` | Your Firebase app ID |
| `measurementId` | Google Analytics measurement ID (optional) |

### Security Note

⚠️ **Important**: Make sure to add your `firebase.js` file to `.gitignore` if it contains sensitive configuration data, or use environment variables for production deployments.

### Environment Variables (Recommended)

For better security, consider using environment variables:

```javascript
const firebaseConfig = {
  apiKey: process.env.REACT_APP_FIREBASE_API_KEY,
  authDomain: process.env.REACT_APP_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN,
  projectId: process.env.REACT_APP_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID,
  storageBucket: process.env.REACT_APP_FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET,
  messagingSenderId: process.env.REACT_APP_FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID,
  appId: process.env.REACT_APP_FIREBASE_APP_ID,
  measurementId: process.env.REACT_APP_FIREBASE_MEASUREMENT_ID
};
```

Create a `.env` file in your project root and add your values:

```
REACT_APP_FIREBASE_API_KEY=your-api-key-here
REACT_APP_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN=your-project-id.firebaseapp.com
REACT_APP_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=your-project-id
REACT_APP_FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET=your-project-id.appspot.com
REACT_APP_FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID=your-sender-id
REACT_APP_FIREBASE_APP_ID=your-app-id
REACT_APP_FIREBASE_MEASUREMENT_ID=your-measurement-id
```

Don't forget to add `.env` to your `.gitignore` file!



# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
